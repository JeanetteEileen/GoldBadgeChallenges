# GoldBadgeChallenges
This is four challenges that were completed for the Eleven Fifty Gold Badge Challenge.  The first is a basic menu using a list with the ability to add/edit/delete items.
The second challenge was for a queue.  You could add/peek/delete items in the queue.
The third challenge used a dictionary to give access to different areas.
The fourth challenge was another list using enums.  This challenge had different types of events and the number of people attending, cost per person and cost per event.
